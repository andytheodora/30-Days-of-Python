# 30 Days of Python - My Learning Journey

Welcome to my 30 Days of Python project repository! This repo contains my daily practice, exercises, and mini-projects as I progress through the 30-day Python learning challenge.

## About This Project

This repository documents my step-by-step journey learning Python programming over 30 days. Each day focuses on different Python concepts ranging from basics to advanced topics, including:

- Variables, Data Types, and Control Flow  
- Functions and Modules  
- File Handling and Regular Expressions  
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes & Objects)  
- Data Analysis with Pandas and NumPy  
- Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- Web Scraping and APIs  
- Machine Learning Basics  
- Web Development with Flask  
- And much more!

Each day includes:

- Notes and explanations of concepts learned  
- Completed coding exercises  
- Mini projects and practical implementations  
- Challenges solved  

## Tools and Libraries Used

- Python 3.x  
- Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) for interactive coding  
- Pandas and NumPy for data analysis  
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization  
- Requests and BeautifulSoup for web scraping  
- Scikit-learn for machine learning  
- Flask for web app development

  ## What I Learned

- Gained a solid foundation in Python syntax and semantics.  
- Developed skills in data handling, analysis, and visualization.  
- Understood web scraping and API integration basics.  
- Built simple machine learning models and web apps.  
- Improved problem-solving and coding style.
